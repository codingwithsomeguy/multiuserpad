# TODO
Too much.  But a few things not to forget:

* A few glaring security holes
* better credentials stashing
* multi file editing
* compile / env safety
* release litmus testing
* unhack a bunch of the live coded main stuff
* handle sharding in the websocket / connection pool shared state
* use sessions, not all sessions in the same jam
* shared splitscreen mode
* auth on the user-only endpoints
* push notifications on whiteboard updates instead of client polling
* move the whiteboard to redis instead of fs
* example of uploading a whiteboard
* allow / require auth on whiteboard (setting)
* twitch (or other) auth
